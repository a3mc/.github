<b><i>Blockchain</i></b> technology, smart <b><i>contracts</i></b> and <b><i>cryptography</i></b> are fast becoming an essential part of the modern world.
<br><br>

It seems there are more blockchains around than croissants in France, who each have their own specific properties, applications and possibilities. Sadly, most of those croissants won't be around anymore in the foreseeable future. On the internet within each specific niche it is usually a winner-takes-all situation.

Nevertheless, we did extensive research into each competitive candidate to decide which ones serve a purpose. By sharing our knowledge <b><i>we help developers and scientists</i></b> make informed decisions onto which blockchains they would want to unleash their brain product and how to approach the ecosystem in which it should live and thrive.
